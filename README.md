# STM32-Based Board Project
This repository contains the design files for an STM32-based custom board. The project includes KiCad files for the schematic and PCB layout, as well as a 3D model (.stp) of the board. The design is tailored for embedded system applications, making use of the STM32 microcontroller for a range of development purposes.

## Features
- STM32 MCU-based design
- KiCad project files for easy customization
- 3D model for visualization
## Usage
- Open the KiCad files to view and modify the design.
- Use the provided 3D model for visualizing or planning enclosures.
